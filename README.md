# 506-practice-workflow
primer for 504/507 fall semester classes

It took me hours to get it, but I think I was able to make it. I really tried my best. Although it was quite similar to what you did before during one of your Python lectures. I wanted to do something simple because I am not an expert yet. I used WBC values and created an if/else statement for it. Initially, I kept getting an error until I realized the issue was the "or" word so I changed it to "and" and it worked. However, my issue is when I input the value "(wbc=3500)," it still comes out as NORMAL. So, I just stuck with "(wbc=5000)" and "(wbc=15000)"
